# awesome-foundation

A battle-tested, production-ready AWS infrastructure foundation built on years of real-world experience managing complex, high-scale systems.

## Overview

**awesome-foundation** is a collection of production-proven AWS infrastructure patterns and best practices, curated by [@allixsenos](https://github.com/allixsenos) from years of running large-scale applications in production.

This repository represents the distilled knowledge of managing AWS infrastructure that has successfully handled **100,000+ requests per second** across many complex services in production environments.

## What's Inside

The stack leverages the following AWS services, orchestrated through CloudFormation:

- **AWS ECS Fargate** - Container orchestration without managing servers
- **AWS RDS Aurora** - Highly available, scalable relational database
- **AWS CloudFormation** - Infrastructure as Code for reproducible deployments

All components have been battle-tested in production scenarios, ensuring reliability, scalability, and operational excellence.

## Who Is This For?

This foundation is designed for:

- **Teams entering the AWS space** looking for a proven starting point
- **Engineers** who want to skip common pitfalls and jump straight to production-ready patterns
- **Organizations** seeking an opinionated, well-architected infrastructure foundation
- **Anyone** who wants to build on a solid foundation with room to grow

## Philosophy

awesome-foundation provides an **opinionated launching pad** that:

- ✅ Sets you up with production-ready infrastructure from day one
- ✅ Gives you room to grow and customize as you explore AWS
- ✅ Avoids common mistakes through battle-tested patterns
- ✅ Reduces time-to-production for new projects
- ✅ Follows AWS best practices and Well-Architected Framework principles

Rather than starting from scratch or navigating countless AWS services alone, you get a solid foundation built on real-world production experience.
